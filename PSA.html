    <center><h1> What Is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?</h1></center>
    <center><p>A mental health condition that develops following a traumatic event characterized by intrusive thoughts about the incident, recurrent distress/anxiety, flashback and avoidance of similar situations.

    <center><h2> Personal Experience</h2></center>
    <center>Many may not know but men, can also suffer from PTSD especially veteran. My brother for example is a victim of this cause that i try to get him the help he needs. at first i didnt believe he had the symptoms but when i started readinging  and researching what it can do to an individual, i realize it was something that is more severe. Till this day he doesnt want to tell me what has happen in the military and what tramatic event has happen to him. He has one of the symstom which is call social avoidance. i never thought when he said to me that i cant be around people i never thought it could be around the public in which he takes medication for.</center>

    <center><h2>What Are Some Treatment</h2></center>
    <center>Depending on how severe your disorder is depends what treatments are right. For example my brother condition is so severe that he has to take medication everyday. Also see therapy for his condition. Than you have individual who need to stay at home clinic. Second thing that may help is speaking to your love one for help. The reason why i say this because sometimes those you love probably have a better understanding in maybe how you feel, especially in certain conditions.Sometimes is also good to to get your mind off things such as working out. which also distresses the situation. I know for myself that help me get over my trauma event when i lost my twins. Lastly if you feel like you might indanger yourself or family maybe stranger PLEASE!!!!!!!! Reach out for help. Below I will put some contact information if anyone is interested.</center>
