    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    
    <p>Hello everyone my name is Pablo acevedo and I was born/raised in Brooklyn ny. One thing I can say about about myself is, I am a humble person when you get to know me. Before everthing my passion was to become a bodybuilder when I was at the age of 22 years old. At that point, I was bodybuilding till the age of 26 years old, when i injured myself on the squating rack lifting 355lb. At that point, I gave up and was scared to go back to bodybuilding. In 2017 everything was a struggle untill I join th USPS, money was great until 2020 I got fired from the usps for child care and my union didnt defend me. In 2020, I was depressed in the time of covid 19. Things were hard but I tried not to let it get the best of me that I decided to go back to college. So  As of right now I am attending <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu"
    target="_blank">Bmcc</a> in getting my AA degree in Nursing. Unfortunatly, I didnt get accepted into there program but im not letting that stop me from achieving my goals. So I will be getting my AA in Health in Science. I will be the first in my family that finish college. I am a Husband/Father to my 5 year old son in which I love them both very much till this day. They both been very supportive during this journey. The reason why i say this is because i lost my dad this year of 2022 on jan 21, at 5:45am. Till this day I cant accept that he is gone because january 21, 2023 make a year. I told myself even though i am still struggling, I am going to make sure I keep my promise to him in finishing school and making sure, I take care of my family just like he did. We didnt have a close relatioship cause we will argue about the stupidest things, but i always tell people the ones that are most annoying cherish most because you never know when there gone. Hope my story can be one that inspires others in achieving their goals. For those who are reading this dont give up in your dream, when you feel like your at the lowest that when you push yourself the hardest.</p>
